summaries:
  1: >
    A mental map for navigating the agent framework landscape.
    Orchestration frameworks vs Agent SDKs vs Agent Servers.
  2: >
    An LLM running tools in a loop. Let's unpack the three primitives:
    models, tools, and the agentic loop.
  3: >
    App-driven vs. agent-driven control flow: who owns the orchestration, the app or the agent?
  4: >
    Specialized tools encode assumptions about how things should be done. Bash and the filesystem are universal primitives that don't limit the agent.
  5: >
    From embedded library to networked service. What capabilities you need to build when crossing the service boundary.
  6: >
    Four real-world projects to showcase different architectural choices: from job agents toOpenClaw personal agents.
  7: >
    Curated references to get deeper into the agent frameworks.
