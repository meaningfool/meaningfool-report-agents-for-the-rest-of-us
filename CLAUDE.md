# Project: Agent SDKs for the Rest of Us

Static website for a technical report. Pure HTML/CSS/JS, no framework.

## Skills to use

- **`dev-browser`** (sawyerhood/dev-browser): Use this skill anytime we need to test how pages render in the browser — visual verification, layout checks, responsiveness. Always prefer this over guessing whether something looks right.
- **`frontend-design`** (.claude/skills/frontend-design.md): Use this skill when building or iterating on HTML/CSS/JS for the site. Guides toward distinctive, non-generic design choices.

## Project structure

- `site/` — The deployable static site (HTML, CSS, JS)
- `_references/` — Design inspiration HTML files (not part of the site)
- `specs/` — Spec-driven development workflow files

## Report sections

The report has 7 sections total:
1. Introduction (preamble + 2x2 mental map framing)
2. What's an agent, anyway?
3. Where orchestration lives
4. Two tools to rule them all: Bash and the filesystem
5. Agent SDK to Agent Server
6. Architecture by example
7. Further Reading (shape TBD)
