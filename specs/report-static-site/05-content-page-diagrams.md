# Spec 05: Content Page Diagrams

## Goal
Create diagrams that illustrate key concepts within the report content pages. The report markdown has TODO placeholders for several diagrams.

## Context
- Content pages built in Spec 03
- Report TODOs reference: 2x2 framework map, progression timeline, onion diagram, flow diagrams
- Diagrams should match the design language (dark backgrounds, acid-green accents, mono labels)

## Slices

TBD — to be defined after Spec 03 (content page prototype) is complete. At that point we'll have the actual content rendered and can identify exactly where diagrams are needed and what they should convey.

### Known diagram candidates (from report TODOs):
- 2x2 framework positioning map (orchestration frameworks vs agent SDKs)
- Historical progression timeline (4 steps in Part 2)
- Onion/layer diagram (agent server architecture in Part 4)
- Flow diagrams (agentic loop, tool-calling flow)
- Case study architecture diagrams (Part 5)

## Shared Components Impacted
- TBD

## Pre-existing Tests Impacted
- None
